## Thesis Project 

### 📌 Project Overview  
This repository contains the code and data analysis conducted for my master's thesis. The study explores the relationship between overtime work and fertility intentions among working women in urban China, within the context of declining fertility rates and toxic overtime culture. The main focus is on experiment design, statistical modeling, and the application of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to examine the psychological factors influencing fertility intentions in response to different levels of overtime work.
